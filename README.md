This project intends to solve a basic problem prevalent in all delivery apps used by restauraunt partners.

The issue is as follows when an employee intends to take a menu item off of the delivery app due to an unavailable ingredient
they have to untick every single menu item that has that ingredient missing. this is prone to mistakes such as a menu item not 
being ticked off when it should be. 

To get around this issue we should just have to list an ingredient as unavailable and all the corresponding items should be taken off the online menu.
